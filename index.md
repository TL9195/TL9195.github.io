### CPSC 120

lab6 - part 2 - guessing game

    I love this one because this is the first one that is a game and has interaction between a user and the code, not just simply calculate or display something.

lab7 - part 2 - Blackjack

    This is the one I like more among many labs. I like this one is because I spent about 6 hours straight doing this lab, and this is challenging for me at that moment. In the end, I didnâ€™t solve this lab by myself, but my partner helped me and fixed the code. When this lab is completed, it gave me the feeling of accomplishment, I also understand the importance of a partner.

lab10 - part3 - color gradient

    This is the first lab to start learning about the color part. It is cool for me to see color displayed in a way that I have never thought about.
